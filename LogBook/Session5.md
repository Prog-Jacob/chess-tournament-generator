**Session 5: Down the Rabbit Hole**

#### Facing Unexpected Challenges:

As the journey into matrix multiplication continued, unexpected challenges reared their heads, particularly in the realm of linear algebra. The initial excitement gave way to the harsh reality that this might be a more formidable beast than anticipated.

#### Considering Plan B or C:

Given the impracticality and overwhelming nature of the matrix multiplication choice, Session 5 became a crossroads. It was time to ponder Plan B or C. Plan B, involving NLP and LEAN integration, proved equally impractical, considering the substantial scope and the prerequisite of natural language conversion to propositional logic. Plan C emerged as a potential refuge, considering course registration assistant as more of a hobby than a university project.

#### Plan D: The Chess Tournament Conundrum:

In contemplating Plan C, an unexpected twist – Plan D entered the scene. The ongoing chess tournament, with its somewhat chaotic format, prompted a rethink. The distaste for its structure led to the idea of creating a program to calculate the best tournament format based on specific criteria. It was a pivot toward a more structured and optimized exploration – a pragmatic turn in the face of evolving challenges.

#### Next Steps:

The immediate focus for the next steps revolves around researching various chess tournament formats. Understanding their rules, structures, and criteria will lay the groundwork for the subsequent development of a program. Simultaneously, the main idea of the program needs to be defined – specifying the criteria or parameters that the program will optimize.
