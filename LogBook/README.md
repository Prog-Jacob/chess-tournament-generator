### Logbook Introduction

Welcome to the logbook documenting my journey through the PBL on CSE at Egypt-Japan University of Science and Technology (E-JUST). Over the next semester (Fall 2023), this log will serve as a comprehensive record of my experiences, insights, and progress in the course. Each Session's entry is designed to provide a detailed account of the topics covered, challenges faced, achievements unlocked, and personal reflections.
