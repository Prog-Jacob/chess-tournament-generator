**Session 1: Getting Started**

#### Goals and Expectations:

Amidst the chaos of unpredictable course schedules, clarity was the objective. This session was about understanding the course's framework, establishing personal goals, and aligning them with the broader objectives of the project.

#### Initial Thoughts and Project Ambitions:

In the midst of potential project ideas, three stood out: optimizing matrix multiplication with optimal tensor assignments for Strassen's algorithm, converting natural language to propositional logic and evaluating it with a software like LEAN, and enhancing the Course Registration Assistant to calculate the tightest schedule for early graduation.

#### Challenges and Considerations:

Each project came with its set of challenges. The matrix multiplication optimization project hinted at mathematical understanding and computational complexities, language conversion suggested a need for expert in multiple fields, and the Course Registration Assistant needed fine-tuning and customizing for practical time complexity.

#### Reflection:

Reflecting on the session emphasized the need for informed decision-making. While ambitious project ideas were on the table, a pragmatic approach surfaced. Prioritizing the Course Registration Assistant project emerged as a strategic move, aligning with both personal proficiency and practical student needs.

#### Next Steps:

Looking ahead, the focus sharpens on refining the selected project. Specific goals, potential challenges, and the roadmap for implementation take center stage. Engaging with the chosen project sets the foundation for a focused and fruitful journey through the upcoming sessions.
