**Session 3: Exploring Matrix Multiplication**

#### Deep Dive into Strassen's Algorithm:

With a determined focus on matrix multiplication, Session 3 submerged into the intricacies of Strassen's Algorithm. The primary goal was to unravel its complexities, comprehend its applications, and zero in on the optimal tensor assignments.

#### Theoretical Readings and Videos:

Starting with smooth and easy-to-follow videos, I transitioned to the more formidable world of theoretical readings. Skimming through various papers, including the not-so-humble "Discovering Faster Matrix Multiplication Algorithms with Reinforcement Learning," provided a broader perspective. Shifting my initial understanding to tensor decomposition, however, proved to be a mental gymnastics routine. Another paper, "A Refined Laser Method and Faster Matrix Multiplication," added more layers to the puzzle. My attempt to find the original Strassen's work hit a dead end, but "Fast Matrix Multiplication: Limitation of the Laser Method" emerged as a significantly better guide, guiding me through its contents at a deliberate pace.

#### Navigating Challenges:

While the videos provided a gentle introduction, the readings were a plunge into the academic deep end. Tensor decomposition demanded a mental acrobatics routine that tested the limits of my comprehension. Seeking the roots in the original Strassen's work proved elusive, but "Fast Matrix Multiplication: Limitation of the Laser Method" became a reliable guide. The realization dawned that reaching a non-trivial point in this semester would demand considerable time, especially given the nature of such work that necessitated delving further down the rabbit hole.

#### Adjusting the Course:

In the face of mounting complexities and time constraints, a strategic pivot became necessary. While the paper exploration was enlightening, the path forward needed recalibration. The decision? Stick with the initial interpretation of the divide-and-conquer method and transition to the experimentation phase. The next session would be dedicated to practical exploration, applying the acquired knowledge to the real-world challenge of optimizing matrix multiplication.
