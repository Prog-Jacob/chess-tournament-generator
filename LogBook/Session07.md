**Session 7: Collaborative Endeavors**

Session 7 of the AI Chess Tournament Generator project delved into the realm of collaborative endeavors, fostering discussions and teamwork among individuals with a shared passion for mathematics and chess. The insightful conversation transpired between myself, Ahmed Salman (a distinguished alumnus from the CSE department), and Rashad Fawzy (a senior ECE student). Given our mutual interest in both mathematics and chess, the discussion unfolded as a valuable exchange of ideas and perspectives.

#### Evolution of Ideas:

The initial focus of the discussion centered around the representation of a chess player solely through their ELO rating, considering that the ELO system was designed to encapsulate various nuances of player performance. However, a pivotal realization emerged early on: two players with identical ratings could exhibit drastically different performances. This discrepancy became evident when contemplating scenarios involving one player on a winning streak juxtaposed with another on a losing streak.

#### Refinement: Introducing Additional Parameters:

To address the observed disparities, we initially introduced a consistency parameter, specifically recent win percentage. While this parameter seemed promising, further contemplation led us to conclude that two parameters were insufficient. A critical missing element was identified—a parameter to account for the range of players' performance. At this juncture, the conversation seamlessly transitioned into the realm of probability distributions.

#### Universal Representation: Recent Ratings:

In the pursuit of a universal and minimalistic representation capturing the intricacies of players' performance, recent ratings emerged as a focal point. These ratings inherently encompassed the essence of a player's standing—offering a calculated location (mean/median/mode), a scale (variance/standard deviation), and shape (consistency/win rate, etc.) for the underlying probability distribution.

#### Decision on Optimization Algorithm:

While acknowledging a limited depth of knowledge in optimization algorithms, a consensus was reached on employing a genetic algorithm. This decision stemmed from my experience with genetic algorithms and their applicability to the task at hand. The discussion touched upon the potential of a dynamic programming approach for generating samples since we presumed the difficulty of generating random tournament with such requirements.

#### Next Steps:

> **Refinement of Probability Models**
>
> -   Building on the collaborative insights gained from Session 7, the next steps involve a meticulous refinement of probability models. The probability distributions, particularly the skewed normal distribution, will undergo further optimization and fine-tuning. Parameters such as mean, standard deviation, and skewness will be adjusted to enhance the accuracy and representativeness of player performances.

> **Implementation of Genetic Algorithm**
>
> -   The decision to employ a genetic algorithm as the optimization tool necessitates its comprehensive implementation. The genetic algorithm will be fine-tuned to align with the specific requirements of the AI Chess Tournament Generator. Key considerations include the genetic operators, selection mechanisms, and termination criteria. Extensive testing and validation will be conducted to ensure the algorithm's efficacy in generating optimal tournament formats.
