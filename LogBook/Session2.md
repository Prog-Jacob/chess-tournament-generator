**Session 2: Reflections on Topics**

#### Overview:

In this session, I delved into the process of topic selection for the project. I started with three ambitious ideas: optimizing matrix multiplication in the Strassen algorithm, converting natural language into propositional logic for statement validation, and enhancing a Course Registration Assistant project to calculate the most efficient graduation schedule.

Each idea presented its own set of challenges and opportunities. The matrix multiplication optimization, a problem that has intrigued scholars since the mid-20th century, offered a chance to contribute to a long-standing mathematical challenge. The natural language processing project required a blend of linguistics and discrete mathematics, making it the most complex of the three in my opinion. The course planner, while practical, would require many fine-tuning, customization, and optimization to handle over 100 courses, far exceeding the current limit of around 15. Also, I find it more of a hobby project to work on in free time.

After careful consideration, I decided to focus on the matrix multiplication optimization. Despite its complexity, I believe it offers the most room for learning and potential for future development. This topic could extend beyond the PBL into potentially Graduation Project 1 & 2 or other research opportunities.

#### Next Steps:

Moving forward, I plan to immerse myself in the existing literature on matrix multiplication optimization. I aim to understand the current state of the field and identify potential areas for innovation.
